  - Added fetch() call to /status endpoint before loading stream
  - Ensures IP authorization is established before video stream request
  - Added user-friendly alert if authentication is required
- Enhanced security while improving user experience
  - IP authorization is bound to client IP address
  - Short expiration time (5 minutes) balances security and convenience
  - Automatic cleanup of expired IP authorizations

**Modified Files:**
1. auth.h - Added IP authorization structures and function declarations
2. auth.cpp - Implemented IP authorization management system
3. temp_index.html - Updated toggleStream() to verify auth before starting stream

**Security Considerations:**
- IP authorization expires after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Each successful page refresh or API call extends the authorization
- IP-based authorization is suitable for home/small office networks
- For public networks, consider reducing IP_AUTH_EXPIRE_TIME

### 2026-01-28 - Added HTTP Basic Authentication and Session Management
**Updates:**
- Created authentication module (auth.h and auth.cpp)
- Implemented HTTP Basic Authentication
- Implemented session management (14-day expiration)
- Added authentication protection for homepage, video stream, photo capture, and camera control interfaces
- After login, users can access other interfaces without re-authentication
- Sessions expire automatically after 14 days

**Modified Files:**
1. auth.h - Authentication module header file
2. auth.cpp - Authentication module implementation
3. app_httpd.cpp - Added authentication checks for various interfaces
4. ESP32_S3_Camera_Monitor.ino - Initialize authentication module

**Technical Features:**
- HTTP Basic Authentication:
  - Uses HTTP Basic Authentication for identity verification
  - Username and password defined in auth.h (AUTH_USERNAME and AUTH_PASSWORD)
  - Creates session and sets Cookie after successful authentication

- Session Management:
  - Session ID generated using random bytes and Base64 encoding
  - Session includes client IP address, creation time, last access time
  - Sessions expire automatically after 14 days (SESSION_EXPIRE_TIME)
  - Supports up to 10 concurrent sessions (MAX_SESSIONS)
  - Periodically cleans up expired sessions (auth_cleanup_expired_sessions)

- Authentication Protection:
  - Homepage (/) requires authentication
  - Video stream (/stream) requires authentication
  - Photo capture interface (/capture) requires authentication
  - System status interface (/status) requires authentication
  - Camera control interfaces (/control, /resolution, etc.) require authentication

- Authentication Flow:
  - First access triggers browser login dialog
  - User enters username and password, server verifies
  - After successful verification, creates session and sets Cookie
  - Subsequent requests use Cookie for authentication, no need to re-enter password
  - Session expires after 14 days, requires re-login

**Username and Password Location:**
- File: auth.h
- Line: Lines 21-22
- Definition:
  ```c
  #define AUTH_USERNAME "admin"
  #define AUTH_PASSWORD "password123"
  ```

**Parameter Adjustments:**

**Next Steps:**
- Implement servo control functionality
- Test video recording stability
- Optimize video quality and file size
- Add video playback functionality

2. Auto-segmentation function issue
   - Problem: Auto-segmentation calling stopVideoRecording() sets isRecording=false, causing subsequent recording failures
   - Fix: Modified stopVideoRecording function, added keepRecordingState parameter
   - Fix: Pass keepRecordingState=true during auto-segmentation to keep recording state
   - Fix: Temporarily set isRecording=false before calling startVideoRecording
   - Result: Auto-segmentation works normally, automatically switches to new video file every 2 minutes

**Technical Features:**
- stopVideoRecording function supports two modes:
  - stopVideoRecording(false): Completely stop recording, set isRecording=false
  - stopVideoRecording(true): Stop current segment but keep recording state, isRecording remains true
- Auto-segmentation flow:
  1. Detect 2-minute duration
  2. Call stopVideoRecording(true) to stop current segment
  3. Temporarily set isRecording=false
